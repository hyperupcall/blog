I was able to bargain for some cheap discounts - and I wanted to plug these computers into my network. Little did I know that I would be in for a wild ride&amp;hellip;
At the time, my LAN did not consist of much: just an old (but still great!)

It&amp;rsquo;s due to some bug in efibootmgr. Ubuntu Server Installer uses efibootmgr to create some NVRAM variables for the UEFI boot process. Unfortunately, efibootmgr failed right in the middle and printed an empty string to stderr, abruptly ending the installation process.
To fix this, I hypothesized that I could somehow redirect the command&amp;rsquo;s stderr to /dev/null using a file descriptor redirect.</description></item><item><title>The UMPIRE Method</title><link>https://hyperupcall.github.io/blog/posts/umpire/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2020 13:23:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://hyperupcall.github.io/blog/posts/umpire/</guid><description>As a part of the CTI Accelerate Program, I learned about a problem-solving technique called &amp;lsquo;UMPIRE&amp;rsquo;.
Also used at CodePath, UMPIRE is especially helpful for solving interview questions.
I&amp;rsquo;m finding the framework especially useful as I haven&amp;rsquo;t used any problem solving skills in years. It&amp;rsquo;s time to end my reliance on pattern matching and inertial intuition!
In Summary There are six steps:
Understand Match Plan Implement Review Evaluate I personally broke down this process into 3 larger steps:</description></item></channel></rss>
