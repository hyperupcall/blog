I was learning Java in my AP Computer Science A class. The class was another one of those &amp;ldquo;college-level&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;advanced placement&amp;rdquo; (AP) classes, which actually became really fun near the end.

I had so much fun making it.</description></item><item><title>Developing my Robotics Teams' Website</title><link>https://hyperupcall.github.io/blog/posts/creating-website-for-robotics-club/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2019 22:58:47 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://hyperupcall.github.io/blog/posts/creating-website-for-robotics-club/</guid><description>During the November of 2018, I became aware of a website competition. I had the opportunity to submit a website that showcased my robotics club by mid-January. Website creation tools (like ones from Wix or Weebly) were not prohibited. After learning this, I thought this competition would be perfect to apply the frontend skills that I recently learned! I knew I probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to win, but I wanted to give it my best shot.</description></item></channel></rss>
