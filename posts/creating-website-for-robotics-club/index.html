I had the opportunity to submit a website that showcased my robotics club by mid-January. Website creation tools (like ones from Wix or Weebly) were not prohibited. After learning this, I thought this competition would be perfect to apply the frontend skills that I recently learned! I knew I probably wasn&rsquo;t going to win, but I wanted to give it my best shot.</p><p>So I created a new repository that November and started working. I made sure to use similar tooling / technologies that I had experience with, because I was still sort of new to web development. I used the <a href=https://vuejs.org>Vue</a> JavaScript framework. I remember feeling <em>ecstatic</em> because Vue Cli 3 just released. Meaning, I didn&rsquo;t have to create my own Webpack config for Vue + Babel + Sass compiling / transpiling & HMR etc. Gosh, that was a nightmare with my first website.</p><h2 id=initial-structure>Initial Structure</h2><p>I made sure to abide by some lessons I&rsquo;ve learned firsthand from my previous website</p><ul><li>Create components from repeated page elements</li><li>Do not make HTML templates large (split up into as many components as possible)</li><li>Avoid creating large <code>.css</code>/<code>.sass</code> stylesheets (so large that they don&rsquo;t fit in their corresponding <code>.vue</code> component)</li></ul><p>Keeping that in mind, I build a basic page showing what the layout would roughly look like.</p><p><img src=../../image/robotics-website/robotics-website-1.png alt=robotics-website-1>

I don&rsquo;t recall the exact reason, but I think I wanted to learn how to create good-looking components on my own. Even if this slowed down development, I enjoyed creating the components. Besides, it made the website look more unique. From my last website I learned that colors and icons can really make or break the look of a website. Luckily I already knew about the great <a href=https://yeun.github.io/open-color>Open Color</a> color pallette and the amazing <a href=https://feathericons.com>Feather Icons</a> icons set.</p><h2 id=simple-architecture-changes>Simple Architecture Changes</h2><p>After a few weeks, I realized the top-level architecture I had previously had to be modified. It looked like the following.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-html data-lang=html>&lt;<span style=color:#6ab825;font-weight:700>template</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span style=color:#6ab825;font-weight:700>div</span> <span style=color:#bbb>id</span>=<span style=color:#ed9d13>&#34;app&#34;</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span style=color:#6ab825;font-weight:700>navbar</span> /&gt;
    &lt;<span style=color:#6ab825;font-weight:700>router-view</span> /&gt;
    &lt;<span style=color:#6ab825;font-weight:700>foot</span> /&gt;
  &lt;/<span style=color:#6ab825;font-weight:700>div</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span style=color:#6ab825;font-weight:700>template</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar, the <code>&lt;router-view/></code> component changes based on the current URL, such as <code>/home</code> or <code>/about</code>.</p><p>There was a Page Heading component inside of <code>router-view</code>, which I later moved out to the parent component. This component consisted of the page title and sub-pages of a route. Previously, I was duplicating the page heading across several components (each of which corresponded to a specific route). This seemed wasteful at best, so I refactored to improve the structure. Looking back, there were other ways to create an abstraction, but that sufficed for the time.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-html data-lang=html>&lt;<span style=color:#6ab825;font-weight:700>template</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span style=color:#6ab825;font-weight:700>div</span> <span style=color:#bbb>id</span>=<span style=color:#ed9d13>&#34;app&#34;</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span style=color:#6ab825;font-weight:700>navbar</span> /&gt;
    &lt;<span style=color:#6ab825;font-weight:700>page-heading</span> /&gt;
    &lt;<span style=color:#6ab825;font-weight:700>router-view</span> /&gt;
    &lt;<span style=color:#6ab825;font-weight:700>foot</span> /&gt;
  &lt;/<span style=color:#6ab825;font-weight:700>div</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span style=color:#6ab825;font-weight:700>template</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>After I refactored, navigation behaved similarly, with simpler code</p><p><img src=../../image/robotics-website/robotics-website-2.gif alt=robotics-website-2>
<a href=https://github.com/eshsrobotics/WebsiteChallenge2019/commit/c231eee522374eb726cd54279bd5cf16c50be654>See Commit on GitHub</a></p><p>Since the previous screenshot, I also added a footer, better animations on the navigation tabs, and placeholder images and text.</p><h2 id=colors>Colors</h2><p>Unfortunately, our team&rsquo;s previous website had little content. So I couldn&rsquo;t really reuse any text or photos. On the plus side, I helped our team organize and upload our photographs to a GitHub repository a few months prior. I was able to browse for photos there.</p><p>After adding the images, I styled some elements with light blue and yellow, which are our team colors.</p><p><img src=../../image/robotics-website/robotics-website-3.png alt=robotics-website-3>

The pictures were too small and the navigation bar overflowed passed the width of the screen.</p><p><img src=../../image/robotics-website/robotics-website-4.png alt=robotics-website-4></p><p>I fixed this by adding a hamburger menu. Also, I adjusted the width of competition cards to fit small devices.</p><p><img src=../../image/robotics-website/robotics-website-mobile.gif alt=robotics-website-mobile-view></p><h2 id=my-favorite-parts>My Favorite Parts</h2><h3 id=sponsor-carousel>Sponsor carousel</h3><p>I had the most fun making the carousel that displayed the club&rsquo;s sponsors. After imagining this effect, I found a <a href=https://github.com/biigpongsatorn/vue-infinite-slide-bar>repository</a> that implemented this feature. For some reason, the scroll effect didn&rsquo;t work unless I put a set width on the element. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s a limitation that probably won&rsquo;t be fixed.</p><p><img src=../../image/robotics-website/robotics-website-5.gif alt=robotics-website-5></p><h3 id=enlarged-photograph-views>Enlarged photograph views</h3><p>I enjoyed animating the photograph card on hover. You can see it in the gif below: On moues hover, the card floats up, the shadow increases, and the &ldquo;enlarge&rdquo; icon fades in and slides to the left.</p><p>The page that shows the enlarged image was pretty cool. At the time, I didn&rsquo;t know any best practices that allowed the image to stay on refresh. For a temporary-permanent solution, I base64 encoded the data that described the image in the URI. Because <code>/</code> is the 63rd character in the base64 format (starting from 0), it created extra routes that were not intended. As a result, I replaced forward slashes with exclamation marks. I had to convert the exclamation marks to forward slashes before decoding the string.</p><p><img src=../../image/robotics-website/enlarge-image-feature.gif alt=robotics-website-enlarge-image-feature></p><h3 id=photo-album>Photo album</h3><p>The photo album is probably the most used feature on this site. Earlier I said that I had to browse for team photos directly through the GitHub interface. By creating this photo gallery, team members can search for photos easily.</p><p><img src=../../image/robotics-website/photo-album.png alt=robotics-website-5></p><p>Since all of our team&rsquo;s photographs are in a GitHub <a href=https://gitub.com/eshsrobotics/database-photos>repository</a>, I just referenced those.</p><h2 id=wrap>Wrap</h2><p>When I started this project, it wasn&rsquo;t clear to me exactly how the final project will look. But, I had a whole lot of fun and learning experience by making incremental changes to the codebase. Although I had to drop some features (like a blogging system and a video album), I absolutely love the final product! From time to time, I revisit the codebase and make incremental changes.</p></div><ul class=article-taxonomy><hr><li><i class="fa fa-category"></i><a href=../../categories/web>web</a></li><li><i class="fa fa-tags"></i><a href=../../tags/vue>vue</a><a href=../../tags/frontend>frontend</a></li></article></main><footer class=footer><ul class=footer-links><li><a href=https://hyperupcall.github.io/blog/index.xml type=application/rss+xml target=_blank><i class="fa fa-rss"></i> RSS feed</a></li><li><a href=../../>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://hyperupcall.github.io/blog/site-notice>Site notice</a></li></ul></footer></div></body><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-88833922-3"></script><script>window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag('js',new Date),gtag('config','UA-88833922-3')</script></html>
