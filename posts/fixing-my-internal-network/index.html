I was able to bargain for some cheap discounts - and I wanted to plug these computers into my network. Little did I know that I would be in for a wild ride&mldr;</p><p>At the time, my LAN did not consist of much: just an old (but still great!) MacBook Pro 2012, a Raspberry Pi 3B+ and a Surface Pro 5, which is my daily driver. The Pi was the only computer on the network with a statically set IP (<code>10.0.0.2</code>) because it was running my DHCP, DDNS, and DNS servers.</p><p>When it came to hooking up the new computers to my switch and router, I had no choice to unplug and rearrange <em>all</em> my computers (space is pretty tight in a college dorm room). I had to get creative and hang my router from some hangers&mldr;</p><p><img src=../../image/fixing-internal-network/setup.jpg alt="Pascal&rsquo;s Triangle"></p><p>So I plugged in everything, and turned all the machines on all at once. Of course, several problems popped up. At the time, I only saw <em>one</em> problem, which eventually caused me to misdiagnose some problems down the line.</p><p>Immediately, I ran into problems. I could not ICMP ping my router from my Surface Pro, even though I was able to do so from my Raspberry Pi. Both were connected directly to the router (not the switch). I checked the ARP table, and the mapping (for my router, <code>10.0.0.1</code>) was in a FAILED state on my Surface, but REACHABLE from my Pi. After testing the CAT 6 ethernet cable (it was still functional), I wasn&rsquo;t sure what else to do - so i just reset the router, which seemed to work.</p><p>But then there was another problem. I was not able to ping my Raspberry Pi from my Surface. I think I was able to ping other hosts from my Raspberry Pi though, but that doesn&rsquo;t make too much sense now that I think about it. It&rsquo;s because the Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s static IP address conflicted with another computer. I had planned to move the DHCP, DDNS, and DNS servers from the Pi to another computer (my trusty Macintosh G5 Tower), and I forgot the operating system I installed onto it had the same IP address. Changing the Pi&rsquo;s IP to prevent collisions fixed this issue.</p><p>But, you guessed it! - there were more problems. These were related to the services I was running on the Pi. The Kea DHCP4 server would no longer start. However, the issue was a simple one to fix. The configuration specified the wrong IP to listen to</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-json data-lang=json>{

</code></pre></div><p>It was no longer <code>10.0.0.2</code>, but a separate one that did not collide with my Mac G5 Tower. Because specifying the IP address was optional in the first place, I just fixed it to <code>"eth0"</code>.</p><p>Frustratingly, BIND9 DNS <em>also</em> stopped working, for a similar reason.</p><pre><code class=language-config data-lang=config>include &quot;/usr/local/etc/bind/named.conf.log&quot;;

options {
  directory &quot;/usr/local/var/cache/bind&quot;;

  listen-on port 53 { 10.0.0.2; };
  listen-on-v6 port 53 { ::1; };
}
...
</code></pre><p>At first, I changed the IP address to the loopback interface <code>127.0.0.1</code>. That didn&rsquo;t work because I forgot the loopback interface is not associated with an actual hardware component that can be connected to from the reset of the network. I changed it to the actual IP address of the Pi (<code>10.0.0.10</code>).</p><p>And lastly, there is one more issue that I almost forgot to mention. Inside of some <code>option-data</code> in my Kea DHCP server, it was configured to continue broadcasting the old Domain Name Server IP.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-json data-lang=json>{
