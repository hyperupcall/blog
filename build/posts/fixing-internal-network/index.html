<p>Somewhat recently, I finalized the purchase of some computers and computer parts on Craigslist. I was able to bargain for some cheap discounts - and I wanted to plug these computers into my network. Little did I know that I would be in for a wild ride...</p>
<p>At the time, my LAN did not consist of much: just an old (but still great!) MacBook Pro 2012, a Raspberry Pi 3B+ and a Surface Pro 5, which is my daily driver. The Pi was the only computer on the network with a statically set IP (<code>10.0.0.2</code>) because it was running my DHCP, DDNS, and DNS servers.</p>
<p>When it came to hooking up the new computers to my switch and router, I had no choice to unplug and rearrange <em>all</em> my computers (space is pretty tight in a college dorm room). I had to get creative and hang my router from some hangers...</p>
<p><img src="/image/fixing-internal-network/setup.jpg" alt="Pascal's Triangle"></p>
<p>So I plugged in everything, and turned all the machines on all at once. Of course, several problems popped up. At the time, I only saw <em>one</em> problem, which eventually caused me to misdiagnose some problems down the line.</p>
<p>Immediately, I ran into problems. I could not ICMP ping my router from my Surface Pro, even though I was able to do so from my Raspberry Pi. Both were connected directly to the router (not the switch). I checked the ARP table, and the mapping (for my router, <code>10.0.0.1</code>) was in a FAILED state on my Surface, but REACHABLE from my Pi. After testing the CAT 6 ethernet cable (it was still functional), I wasn't sure what else to do - so i just reset the router, which seemed to work.</p>
<p>But then there was another problem. I was not able to ping my Raspberry Pi from my Surface. I think I was able to ping other hosts from my Raspberry Pi though, but that doesn't make too much sense now that I think about it. It's because the Raspberry Pi's static IP address conflicted with another computer. I had planned to move the DHCP, DDNS, and DNS servers from the Pi to another computer (my trusty Macintosh G5 Tower), and I forgot the operating system I installed onto it had the same IP address. Changing the Pi's IP to prevent collisions fixed this issue.</p>
<p>But, you guessed it! - there were more problems. These were related to the services I was running on the Pi. The Kea DHCP4 server would no longer start. However, the issue was a simple one to fix. The configuration specified the wrong IP to listen to</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": ["eth0/10.0.0.2"],
        "dhcp-socket-type": "raw"
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>It was no longer <code>10.0.0.2</code>, but a separate one that did not collide with my Mac G5 Tower. Because specifying the IP address was optional in the first place, I just fixed it to <code>"eth0"</code>.</p>
<p>Frustratingly, BIND9 DNS <em>also</em> stopped working, for a similar reason.</p>
<pre><code class="language-config">include "/usr/local/etc/bind/named.conf.log";

options {
  directory "/usr/local/var/cache/bind";

  listen-on port 53 { 10.0.0.2; };
  listen-on-v6 port 53 { ::1; };
}
...
</code></pre>
<p>At first, I changed the IP address to the loopback interface <code>127.0.0.1</code>. That didn't work because I forgot the loopback interface is not associated with an actual hardware component that can be connected to from the reset of the network. I changed it to the actual IP address of the Pi (<code>10.0.0.10</code>).</p>
<p>And lastly, there is one more issue that I almost forgot to mention. Inside of some <code>option-data</code> in my Kea DHCP server, it was configured to continue broadcasting the old Domain Name Server IP.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    "name": "domain-name-servers",
    "code": 6,
    "space": "dhcp4",
    "csv-format": true,
    "data": "10.0.0.2"
}
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, I did not want to give the clients to my DHCP server the wrong IP address, so I had to change that as well.</p>
<p>So in conclusion, after changing my network topology, I faced several issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Could not ping my router (router bugged?)</li>
<li>Two devices on the network had the same IP address</li>
<li>DHCP servers were listening on the correct interface, but at the wrong (old) IP address</li>
<li>DNS servers were listening on the wrong (old) IP address</li>
<li>DHCP servers were broadcasting the old IP of the DNS servers</li>
</ul>
<p>The one key takeaway I learned is that it's a terrible idea to update / change operating systems (especially multiple at once!) while simultaneously changing the network topology.</p>
