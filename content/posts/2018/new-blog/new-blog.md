I decided to create a new blog. I'm mostly going to write about my programming projects and some programming topics. The objective of this blog is to increase my understanding of various programming topics, since explaining a topic will yield better conceptual understanding (of that topic).

This blog was created using Hugo, one of the fastest static-site generators. It has speed, wide-support, and great themes.

Overtime, I'll style the blog to my liking and (hopefully) post many high-quality blogs.
