      <description>During the November of 2018, I became aware of a website competition. I had the opportunity to submit a website that showcased my robotics club by mid-January. Website creation tools (like ones from Wix or Weebly) were not prohibited. After learning this, I thought this competition would be perfect to apply the frontend skills that I recently learned! I knew I probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to win, but I wanted to give it my best shot.</description>
